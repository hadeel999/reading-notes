# Application State with Redux

## Getting Started with Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.

## Three Principles

Redux can be described in three fundamental principles:

- ### Single source of truth
The global state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

- ### State is read-only
The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

- ### Changes are made with pure functions
To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
