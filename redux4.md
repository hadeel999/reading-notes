# Redux - Additional Topics

## Redux Toolkit
The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.

- Simple:
Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.

- Opinionated:
Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.

- Powerful:
Takes inspiration from libraries like Immer and Autodux to let you write "mutative" immutable update logic, and even create entire "slices" of state automatically.

- Effective:
Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.


## Hookstate
The most straightforward, extensible and incredibly fast state management that is based on React state hook.

- Easy to Use:
Concise, pragmatic but flexible API. Very easy to learn.

- Incredibly Fast:
Incredible performance based on unique method for tracking of used/rendered and updated state segments. Ideal solution for huge states and very frequent updates.

- Feature Rich:
Small core library packed with features: global states, local states, asynchronously loaded states, partial state updates, deeply nested state updates, and a lot more.

- First-class Typescript:
Complete type inferrence for any complexity of structures of managed state data. Full IntelliSense support tested in VS Code.

- Plugins System:
Extend or customize your state hooks. There are several standard plugins available: state snapshoting and rolling back, tracking modified fields, state validation, local storage persistence and a lot more.

- Development Tools:
Develop like a pro. Browser's extension to trace and set state values, to set breakpoints on state changes, to identify components using a segment of a state, and a lot more.
